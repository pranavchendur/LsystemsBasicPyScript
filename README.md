# Python implementation of Lindenmayer Systems

A Lindenmayer system, also known as an L-system, is a string rewriting system that can be used to generate fractals with dimension between 1 and 2.

Submitted for the Theory of Computation Course at VIT University, Chennai Campus.

This script when input with a L-system compatible equation can return with fractals drawn using Python's turtle library.
